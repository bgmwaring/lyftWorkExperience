# lyftWorkExperience

## Description

This project is part of my Lyft virtual work experience. The goal of this programme is to create a scallable system, in which to determine which vehices in Lyft rental fleet are in need of servicing. OOP allows for a simple way of giving the user the ability to add engine/ battery types and customise wehicle fits.
